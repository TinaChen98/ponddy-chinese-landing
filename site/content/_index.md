Ponddy scaffolds language learning in unique ways and makes it easy for instructors to create custom curricula in order to better meet the needs of their language learners.\"\t"

        text: "\"Ponddy really saves me a lot of time.  I no longer have to pre-record lessons or search for authentic content as Pondlets come with native audio and in-context definitions.  The students learn on their own time and at their own pace.  They have fun doing the gamified exercises.  They come to class prepared, saving time for more meaningful group activities instead of vocabulary drilling.\"\t"
